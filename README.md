## About

Gamestonk Terminal is an awesome stock and crypto market terminal that has been developed for fun, while I saw my GME shares tanking. But hey, I like the stock ðŸ’ŽðŸ™Œ.

The implementation (in python) allows to easily add more commands, and expand on their configuration.

Feel free to request features, I'll be happy to work on them on my spare time.

## Install <a name="Install"></a>

This project was written and tested with Python 3.6.8.

In order to install, you must run:

```text
git clone https://github.com/DidierRLopes/GamestonkTerminal
cd GamestonkTerminal/
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then run:

```text
